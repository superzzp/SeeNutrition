## Overview

`RestKit` is a dependency used in the [IBM Watson Swift SDK](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/swift-sdk).
It provides the networking layer used by the Swift SDK to communicate between your iOS app and Watson services.
For more information on IBM Watson services, visit the [IBM Watson homepage](https://www.ibm.com/watson/).



## Requirements

- Xcode 9.3+
- Swift 4.1+
- iOS 10.0+



## Installation

RestKit can be installed with [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/), [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), or [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/).

### Cocoapods

You can install Cocoapods with [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/):

```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

If your project does not yet have a Podfile, use the `pod init` command in the root directory of your project. To install RestKit using Cocoapods, add the following to your Podfile (substituting `MyApp` with the name of your app). 

```ruby
use_frameworks!

target 'MyApp' do
    pod 'RestKit', '~> 2.0'
end
```

Then run the `pod install` command, and open the generated `.xcworkspace` file. To update to a newer release of RestKit, use `pod update RestKit`.

For more information on using Cocoapods, refer to the [Cocoapods Guides](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/index.html).

### Carthage

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

If your project does not have a Cartfile yet, use the `touch Cartfile` command in the root directory of your project. To install RestKit using Carthage, add the following to your Cartfile. 

```
github "watson-developer-cloud/restkit" ~> 2.0
```

Then run the following command to build the dependencies and frameworks:

```bash
$ carthage update --platform iOS
```

Follow the remaining Carthage installation instructions [here](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#getting-started). Make sure to drag-and-drop the built `RestKit.framework` into your Xcode project and import it in the source files that require it.

### Swift Package Manager

Add the following to your `Package.swift` file to identify RestKit as a dependency. The package manager will clone RestKit when you build your project with `swift build`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/restkit", from: "2.0")
]
```
